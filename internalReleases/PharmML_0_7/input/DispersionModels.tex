%\label{ch:DispersionModels}
%Following models are used for over dispersed data
%\begin{itemize}
%\item 
%negative binomial 1 (NB1) with r -- \emph{number of failures} and p -- \emph{success probability},
%\item 
%negative binomial 2 (NB2) with $\lambda$ -- \emph{Poisson intensity} and $\tau$ -- \emph{over-dispersion},
%\item 
%generalised Poisson (GP)
%\item 
%zero inflated Poisson (ZIP)
%\item 
%zero inflated negative binomial (ZINB)
%\end{itemize}
