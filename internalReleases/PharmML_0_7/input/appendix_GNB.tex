\section{Generalised Negative Binomial Distribution}
\subsection*{Introduction}
The \emph{negative binomial} distribution, NB, was first proposed almost 
100 years ago in 1920 by Greenwood \& Woods, \cite{greenwood1920inquiry}, 
but its generalisation for both \emph{binomial} and NB distributions called the 
\emph{generalised negative binomial distribution}, GNB, was found 
more then 50 years later by Jain \& Consul (1971), \cite{jain1971generalized}. 
The PMF of the GNB is defined for $0<\alpha<1$ and $|\alpha \beta| < 1$ 
and reads in Jain \& Consul paper
\begin{align*}
b_{\beta}(x,n,\alpha) &= 
\frac{n \; \Gamma(n+\beta x)}{x! \;\Gamma(n + \beta x - x +1)}  \; \alpha^x (1-\alpha)^{n+\beta x-x}, n>0, x=0,1,2,3,...
\end{align*}
such that $b_{\beta}(x,n,\alpha) = 0 \text{ for } x \leq m \text{ if } n+\beta m < 0.$\\
Interestingly, following distributions are special cases of the GNB distribution
\begin{itemize}
\item 
binomial, B(n,p)
\item 
negative binomial, NB(r,p)\footnote{This corresponds to the NB1 parameterisation 
of the negative binomial distribution in ProbOnto, \cite{Swat:2015a}.}
\item 
inverse binomial, IB(k,p)
\end{itemize}
which will be shown in the following sections.

\subsection*{GNB($\alpha$,$\beta$) $\rightarrow$ B($n$,$p$)}
According to Jain \& Consul, \cite{jain1971generalized}, GNB reduces to B for $\beta = 0$ and 
indeed this can be shown (replacing $\alpha$ with $p$) as follows
\begin{align*}
 b_{\beta}(x,n,\alpha) \rightarrow P_{B}(x;n,p): %= \binom {k+r-1}k (1-p)^r p^k \nonumber
 \frac{n \; \Gamma(n+\beta x)}{x! \;\Gamma(n + \beta x - x +1)}  \; \alpha^x (1-\alpha)^{n+\beta x-x} \rightarrow 
\frac{n \; \Gamma(n)}{x! \;\Gamma(n - x +1)}  \; p^x (1-p	)^{n-x} 
\end{align*}
with the first term in the last expression $\frac{n \; \Gamma(n)}{x! \;\Gamma(n - x +1)} = \frac{n (n-1)!}{x! (n-x)!} 
= \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!} = {n \choose x}$ we get the expected result
\begin{align*}
P_{B}(x;n,p) = {n \choose x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}. % \quad \text{ with } \quad 0<p<1, n>0, x=0,1,2,3,....
\end{align*}

\subsection*{GNB($\alpha$,$\beta$) $\rightarrow$ NB($r$,$p$)}
According also to Jain \& Consul, \cite{jain1971generalized}, GNB reduces to NB for $\beta = 1$ and 
indeed this can be shown (replacing $\alpha$ with $p$ and $n$ with $r$) as follows
\begin{align*}
 b_{\beta}(x,n,\alpha) \rightarrow P_{N\!B}(x;r,p):
 \frac{n \; \Gamma(n+\beta x)}{x! \;\Gamma(n + \beta x - x +1)}  \; \alpha^x (1-\alpha)^{n+\beta x-x} \rightarrow 
\frac{r \; \Gamma(r + x)}{x! \;\Gamma(r + 1)}  \; p^x (1-p)^{r} 
\end{align*}
with the first term $\frac{r \; \Gamma(r + x)}{x! \;\Gamma(r + 1)} = \frac{r \; (r + x - 1)!}{x! \;r!} = \frac{(r + x - 1)!}{x! \;(r-1)!}
= {r + x - 1 \choose x}$ we get the correct PMF
\begin{align*}
P_{N\!B}(x;r,p) = {r + x - 1 \choose x} p^x (1-p)^r  .
\end{align*}


\subsection*{GNB($\alpha$,$\beta$) $\rightarrow$ IB($k$,$p$)}
Yanagimoto, \cite{yanagimoto1989inverse}, proposed the \emph{inverse binomial} 
distribution as another special case of GNB for $\beta = 2, \alpha=1-p$ and $n=k$, which 
can be derived as the following shows 
\begin{align*}
b_{\beta}(x,n,\alpha) \rightarrow P_{I\!B}(x;k,p):
 \frac{n \; \Gamma(n+\beta x)}{x! \;\Gamma(n + \beta x - x +1)}  \; \alpha^x (1-\alpha)^{n+\beta x-x} \rightarrow 
\frac{k \; \Gamma(k + 2x)}{x! \;\Gamma(k + x + 1)}  \; (1-p)^x p^{k+x} 
\end{align*}
and the result follows in agreement with the formulation in \cite{yanagimoto1989inverse}, i.e.
\begin{align*}
P_{I\!B}(x;k,p) = \frac{k \; \Gamma(2x + k)}{\Gamma(x+1) \;\Gamma(x + k + 1)}  \; p^{k+x} (1-p)^x ,
\end{align*}
and from $|\alpha \beta| < 1$ and $0<\alpha<1$ one can derive the required condition for p, $1/2 < p < 1$.\\
Interestingly, IB has a medical application. Yanagimoto, \cite{yanagimoto1989inverse}, 
used the distribution it estimate the proportion of discharged patients who can be 
expected to stay completely free from some disease. In the original paper a dataset
for relapse of pulmonary tuberculosis was analysed.
